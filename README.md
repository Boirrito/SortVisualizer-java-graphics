## About
This project will be expanded to practice and reinforce my knowledge of Swing and java graphics for the upcoming semester (2)

## Sort Visualizer

**Code is subject to change. This is merely a prototype with basic function**

The Application can be used to visualize different sorting algorithms by mapping numbers stored in an array to respectively sized bars.
